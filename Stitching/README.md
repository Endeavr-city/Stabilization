For Video Stitching, we have provided a brief summary of the contents of each code file below-
1. mergedVideo.py - Outputs a non-stabilized, stitched video feed, using two cameras. 
2. orbVideo.py - One specific method of stitching implementation, which contains key functions.  
3. siftVideo.py - Second specific method of stitching implementation, which contains key functions. 
4. testCameras.py - Verifies which specific camera feeds are being captured in real-time, to identify which camera is in use. 
5. testStitcher.py - Program outputs a stitched video frame and returns stitched frame to screen. 
6. testVideo.py - Stitching implementation similar to orbVideo, refer to orbVideo for detailed commentary.
